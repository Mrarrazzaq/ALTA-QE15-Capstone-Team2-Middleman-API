# Middleman API Automation Testing

# About The Project
This project is designed to automate the testing of CRUD operations on a given API. 
By using automated tests, we aim to ensure that the API functions correctly and that data is processed accurately.
Automated testing helps in identifying issues early, ensuring consistent behavior,
and reducing the manual effort required for regression testing.
